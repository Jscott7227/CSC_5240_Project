# CSC_5240_Project

To run our code, you need both jupyter notebook and python. 
Download the libraries in the requirements.txt. Go to your terminal
and type jupyter notebook. The local host website should pop up. There
should be a dashboard showing all of your files. 
Find our Loan_predicitions.ipynb and click on it. Run each cell starting at the 
top. That should be everything.
